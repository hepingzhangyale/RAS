Toy Example
Executing the ras.R script will generate outputs in the ./result subdirectory. This script is set up with a toy example to demonstrate its functionality.

Using Real Data
To adapt the script for real data, follow these steps:
1. Open ras.R: Locate the sections where dummy data are created.
2. Replace Dummy Data: Substitute these sections with your real dataset. Ensure that your data adhere to the format and structure expected by the script.
3. Execute the Script: Run ras.R again to produce results based on your data.


Required R library: segmented
